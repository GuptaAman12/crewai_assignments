The provided Python code calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer. To review this code, I need to assess its correctness, readability, and potential optimizations. The function calculate_factorial(n: int) -> int is well-structured and clear in its purpose. It correctly handles the edge case where n is 0 and raises a ValueError for negative integers. The code is readable and follows standard professional guidelines for documentation. However, for large inputs, this recursive approach could be optimized. For instance, using an iterative method or memoization could improve performance by avoiding redundant calculations. Additionally, input validation could be enhanced by checking if the input is an integer, as the function does not handle non-integer inputs. Overall, the code is correct, readable, and well-documented but could benefit from optimizations for large inputs and enhanced input validation.
